## Tracking Weekly Caloric Consistency

As part of my personal fitness journey, I started collecting data on my daily nutritional intake. The graph below visualizes my caloric consumption over a typical week compared to my maintenance target.

### What is Visualized?
The bar chart displays the total calories consumed (blue bars) for each day of the week, from Monday to Sunday. The red dashed line represents my daily caloric target of **2200 kcal**.
* **X-axis:** Days of the week.
* **Y-axis:** Total Calories (kcal).
* **Data Source:** Personal food logs recorded via MyFitnessPal.

### The Story & Rationale
**The Story:**
I noticed my weight was fluctuating despite "feeling" like I was eating consistently. I decided to visualize the data to find the pattern. The visualization reveals a clear trend: I tend to under-eat on weekdays (Wednesday/Sunday) to "save" calories, but then over-consume significantly on Saturdays (2600 kcal), which disrupts my weekly average.

**Rationale for Visualization Choices:**
* **Bar Chart vs. Line Chart:** I chose a bar chart because daily intake is a discrete total for that specific day, making it easier to compare the magnitude of each day against the others.
* **Target Line:** Overlaying the red target line provides an immediate "benchmark" for the viewer to see which days were compliant (under/on target) and which were outliers.
* **Annotations:** I added the exact numerical values on top of the bars so the viewer doesn't have to guess the exact calorie count by looking at the Y-axis.

### Code Implementation

I used Python's `matplotlib` library to generate this chart.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

days = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
intake = [2100, 2250, 1950, 2400, 2150, 2600, 1800]
target = [2200] * 7

plt.bar(days, intake, color='skyblue', label='Actual Intake')
plt.plot(days, target, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Target')
plt.title('Weekly Caloric Intake')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
