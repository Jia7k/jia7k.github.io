## Hello, I'm Jia Rong

I am currently a student at **SIT** (Singapore Institute of Technology). This website serves as a portfolio of my technical projects, data visualization work, and learning reflections.

### About Me
I have a strong interest in software development and automation. My work often involves building tools that solve real-world problems, such as automating news delivery or analyzing personal data trends.
