title: "Reflection on the use of GenAI"
---

## Tool Selection
For this assessment, I utilized **Gemini** as my primary Generative AI assistant. I chose this tool because of its strong capability in handling both natural language processing (for content drafting) and code generation (for Python and Markdown formatting).

## How GenAI Assisted Me
The AI played the role of a "Pair Programmer" and content strategist throughout the development of this website.

### 1. Content Drafting & Structuring
I provided the AI with raw details about my personal projects (such as my **Tele-Forex-News-Bot**), and it helped me restructure those points into a professional "Project" page. It automatically applied correct Markdown syntax, such as headers, bolding for emphasis, and blockquotes for challenges.

### 2. Data Visualization
One of the most helpful aspects was in the creation of the Data Visualization page. I asked the AI to help me visualize my fitness tracking data.
* It suggested a **bar chart** combined with a **target line** to show nutritional consistency.
* It generated the actual **Python (Matplotlib)** code to render the graph, which I then documented on the website.

## Benefits and Challenges

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | It significantly reduced the time spent on writing boilerplate code (like the YAML configuration). |
| **Clarity** | It helped articulate technical concepts (like the Node.js architecture of my bot) more clearly than I could have alone. |
| **Challenge** | A challenge was ensuring the specific syntax for Quarto (like image alignment) was correct, as the AI sometimes defaults to standard Markdown. |

## Future Application
Going forward, I see GenAI not as a replacement for coding, but as an accelerator. I plan to use it to:
1.  **Debug Code:** Quickly identify syntax errors in my C or Node.js projects.
2.  **Brainstorm:** Generate ideas for features in future software applications.

## Final Thoughts
Using GenAI allowed me to focus more on the *content* and *story* of my portfolio rather than getting stuck on the syntax details of web development.
