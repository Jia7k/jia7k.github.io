## Fixed-Gear Cycling

Beyond coding and studying, my main passion is fixed-gear cycling (Track bikes). Unlike standard road bikes, a fixed-gear bike has no freewheel—meaning if the bike is moving, the pedals are turning.

### My Ride: Cinelli Vigorelli Alu 2018
I currently ride a **Cinelli Vigorelli**, a frame known for its aggressive geometry and track heritage. 

**My Current Setup:**
* **Frame:** Cinelli Vigorelli Alu (2018)
* **Type:** Fixed Gear / Track
* **Riding Style:** Urban & Track Training

### Why I Ride
> "Cycling is the closest you can get to flying while remaining on the ground."

Riding fixed gear offers a unique connection between the rider and the road. It requires constant awareness and physical control, which I find to be the perfect mental reset after a long day of programming.

### Other Interests
* **Fitness & Nutrition:** I actively track my macros and training metrics to optimize performance (as seen on my [Data Visualization](dataviz.qmd) page).
* **Tech tinkering:** I enjoy messing around with automated scripts and bots in my spare time.
