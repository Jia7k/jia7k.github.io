title: "Project: Forex News Bot"
---

## Overview
For this project, I developed the **Tele-Forex-News-Bot**, an automated tool designed to deliver real-time foreign exchange (Forex) news updates directly to users via Telegram.

The goal was to create a low-latency notification system that helps traders stay updated with market-moving news without constantly refreshing websites.

## Technical Architecture

I built this application using a modern JavaScript stack and cloud deployment.

* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Platform:** Telegram Bot API
* **Deployment:** Render (Cloud Application Hosting)
* **Version Control:** Git

### Key Features
1.  **Automated Fetching:** The bot scrapes/fetches financial news from configured sources.
2.  **Instant Notifications:** Uses the Telegram API to push alerts immediately to the user's device.
3.  **24/7 Uptime:** Deployed on Render to ensure the service runs continuously in the background.

## Development Challenges

> "One of the main challenges was managing the deployment pipeline on Render to ensure the bot automatically restarted if it crashed."

I resolved this by configuring the build commands correctly in the Render dashboard and implementing robust error handling in the Node.js scripts to catch API failures gracefully.

## Future Improvements
I plan to add sentiment analysis to the news feeds, allowing the bot to tag news as "Bullish" or "Bearish" automatically.
