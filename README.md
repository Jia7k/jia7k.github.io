# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using **Quarto**. It was developed as part of my coursework at SIT to showcase my technical projects, data visualization skills, and learning reflections.

## 📂 Project Structure

The website is structured as follows:

- **`index.qmd`**: The homepage introducing myself and my background.
- **`fyp.qmd`**: A detailed showcase of my **Tele-Forex-News-Bot** (Node.js/Telegram API).
- **`dataviz.qmd`**: A data visualization page analyzing my weekly fitness and caloric intake using Python.
- **`reflection.qmd`**: A reflection on the role of Generative AI in my development workflow.
- **`styles.css`**: Custom CSS for styling the navigation, buttons, and typography.
- **`_quarto.yml`**: The main configuration file for site navigation and theme.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
